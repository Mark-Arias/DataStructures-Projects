Project 6 Report
Mark S Arias
Upon running the test script at home, I was able to get 16/20 of the tests to pass.
I failed the 4 that were related to building and implementing copy constructors and assignment 
operators for this project. I spent quite a lot of time to no sucess trying to get that feature 
implemented and working.I left the attempts at getting it to work in the project, but commented
out the functions.

the bst class though works very well.
